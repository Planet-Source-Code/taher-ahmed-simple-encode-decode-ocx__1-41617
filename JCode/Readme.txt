This is my 2nd encryption OCX
This one builds a table for the chars. with x and y values.
Supported chars. are:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
0123456789
-_.,;'"()
[Space][Enter]

If an unknown char. is encoded it comes out of the decoding as a space...

Hope you like it.. plz rate,,,,,,
